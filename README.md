This is a figma plugin that helps us achieve better color consistency while we design.

## Check Stray Colors

**What?**

Checks all the colours in the selected frame that aren't using the intended functional colors defined from our design library.

**Why?**

Because sometimes it's okay hastely mock something up with the color picker (we're all guity of this, don't lie). But this tool should help us clean up this mess afterwards.

**When?**

- Before handing off to developers.
- Before converting the frame to dark / light themes.


## Convert to Dark / Light Theme

**What?**

One click operation to convert the entire frame to Dark / Light theme function colours

**Why?**

Because doing it one by one under the native Figma "Selection Color" is laborious.

**When?**

Anytime, no restrictions.
